# Cycle - Hyperlocal Weather Application for Cyclists

This application provides an extensive backend, containing data of the most popular bike parks and trails throughout the UK. It uses a hyperlocal weather library, and uses an algorithm I have built to calculate the conditions of the trails, therefore giving an idea the user on what the trail will be like, befire they get to the area.

It also features geo-fencing, giving the user only the trails that are closest to them based on a 30 mile radius from their location.
